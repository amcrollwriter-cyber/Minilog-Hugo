I'm a fantasy writer from London with degrees from Goldsmiths, University of London and the University of Cambridge. I write novels combining magic and politics, centring queer and/or disabled characters.&#x20;

When not writing, I teach in a school for autistic teenagers and write book reviews.

I'm represented by Maddy Belton of Madeline Milburn Literary Agency.&#x20;
